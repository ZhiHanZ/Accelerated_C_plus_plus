# Accelerated_C_plus_plus
This repo will implement the code in <Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example> written by  Andrew Koenig, Barbara E. Moo. 
For every chapter, I made a document, and those files named begin in "c" is the code in the book.
While those files named	begin in "hw" is the homework I made about this book.(Correctness ""CANNOT"" be guranteed)
